# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor - Client Request

```
Refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible and improve their codebase for long term sustainability. Ensure that all links are functioning correctly and clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page. I create a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines
